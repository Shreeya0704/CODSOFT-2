A digital clock built with HTML and CSS offers a sleek and functional way to keep track of time. HTML provides the basic structure, defining the elements that display the hours, minutes, and seconds. CSS takes the reins on design, transforming that structure into a visually appealing clock. While HTML creates the foundation, it's CSS that determines the font, size, color, and overall layout of the clock. This combination delivers a timepiece that's both informative and aesthetically pleasing. Interestingly, this digital clock marks CODSOFT's second task, showcasing their growing expertise in crafting web experiences. Thanks to CODSOFT for this opportunity to explore the building blocks of a digital clock!
